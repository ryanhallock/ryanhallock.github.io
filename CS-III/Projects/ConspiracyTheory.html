    <h1>Conspiracy?</h1>

    <h2>Basics of Recommendation Algorithims</h2>
    <p>
      Their are few types of basic algotrithims, we will dive into two, Collabrative and content-based filtering. Content based filtering works by understanding the topic of the post and reccomending similar posts. Collabrative Filterting is where simmilar intrested people read content, and their reccomendations are shared.
    </p>
    <h2>Feedback loop</h2>
    <p>
      The feedback loop is a concern that many companys exploit. If you only get recommended the information you want. There is only one way of thinking about it. The thoughts you have are staying with you. If you decide that you want belive the earth is flat, you will get reccomended to posts about the earth being flat.
    </p>
    <h2>Algorithimic Amplfication</h2>
    <p>
      While tracking how peole are is true. Companies that rely on user engangment for profit also sell advertisers data on how you are. When a product is free you are the product. So suggesting content that makes them more money creates a more bias for the algorithim as another paramater to add
    </p>
    <h2>Incentives</h2>
    <p>
      The same from promoting profit over all happens when they are inctivited to remove the human. The entire job of a company is to make as much money with the least amount of effort. If they want to promote things that are relavant to how you think but might be baised, they would show you the content. Changing this to only show the "truthful" content limits the content on the platform and will drive away some users.
    </p>
    <h2>Exploitation</h2>
    <p>
      Since companies are trying to make money they will exploit the human mind. Think of the dopamine, a very addictive compound for your brain. Companies would create short form video to drive down the attention span but give you some dopamine from watching the topics you are intrested in. While all topics on a face value could be miseleading and the ways they will try to bait you in with advertisement happens too.
    </p>

    <h1>Ethical?</h1>
    <p>
      Some of these topics are uneathical, should we remove the human componet from our website to squeeze our users into advertisments. It could be unethical to restict content from point of view topics. The company tries to do anything to protect their bottom line and if that takes moderating and restricting the flow of content that will be done.
