    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      The idea for our project was to make a game, we decided to create a game based off `Simon`.
      <br><br>
      The game was a group project written in Swift under
      <a href="https://github.com/TheCoderMerlin/Igis" class="inline">Igis</a>
      a tool for creating graphical games.
    </p>

    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      The motivation that we could do all these cool ideas and make the game look awesome.

    <h3>Code Segments</h3>


    <h4>Example 1 - Box Animations</h4>
    <p>
      We would create boxes to serve as input relays.
      Everytime a box was pressed we would set the active state for a duration amount of frames.
      The way we did this was calling <code>func animate(time: Int)</code> in our Box class.
      <br><br>
      This allowed us to call it in any box instance simplifying the code process.
    </p>


    <h4>Example 2 - Input Handling</h4>
    <p>
      Input handling was handled by an array, storing the keymap to input in the game.
      When a key was pressed the array called <code>playerControls</code> would take in the input and produce a location.
      The input would then be passed to the correct executor determined by the key press to <code>func handlePlayerKey(executorSide: PlayerSide, key: String)</code>.
      <br><br>
      This allowed us to simplify and allow more than two player if required on the screen, since you can come up with controls to each side.
    </p>


    <h4>Example 3 - Color Graphical Hacks</h4>
    <p>
      No graphical/game engine is perfect. We had to create some custom functions to deal with some color issues.
      No String constructor was provided for the <code>Color</code> class.
      <br><br>
      First, we had to write the colors in a tupple array.
      The array would store all the hex color codes for player color pallets.
      <br><br>
      Second, we would pass the tupple array into <code>convertArrayToPallete(colors: [(String, String, String?, String?)]) -> [ActiveColorStyle]</code>.
      The last two strings are optional as they could be auto generatated, but kept for overrides.
      <br><br>
      Third, the function would then map all the hex codes to <code>Color</code> class, used in Igis
      , to a custom function that's name is really long so it will be shortened to <code>func CMIINNADASCFCBDNSWHTRTUT(hexColor: String?) -> Color</code>.
      <br><br>
      This function would take in the hex color and split and convert it into 3 <code>UInt8</code> instance's required by the <code>Color</code> class,
      and then return that new color.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      As the project continued we realized we, didn't allocate enough time towards the project
      , this forced some ideas to be moved away and the goal was to just make it working.
      <br><br>
      We used Igis, to see what exactly was possible, and you can do a lot of cool things in <a href="https://github.com/TheCoderMerlin/Igis" class="inline">Igis</a> as our peers and group found out.
