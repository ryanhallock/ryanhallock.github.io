    <h1 id="ai">Sentient AI is Beneficial but ...</h1>
    <p>
      When the topic of AI is discussed, we think about the image processing or the sound recognition.
      We also experienced the event of automated robot-calls and simple voice creation.
      Now today the graphics of AI have changed to be creative, creating sound, art and even videos.
      AI is becoming smarter due to us humans and not learning (yet).

      Sentient AI is where it should be able to think, perceive and feel rather than faking by simplification.
      The amount of compute power required to create a AI that can freely think and rewrite itself,
      is not currently possible with our current computer power, but may be viable in a bot-net creation over the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sentient AI is possible and created, it will highly benefit humanity.
      Creating a entity that has all the equatable power to solve any problem. It could usher in a new era of technological advancement.

      Sentient AI has its drawbacks, there is constant fear-mongering with AI taking over the world.
      Someone would of have had to let or programmed the AI to do that.
      Sentient AI also does not have the capability to learn further than what is can process or what we teach it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could learn a lot from being allowed to surf the web, but the web is not the most unbiased and truthful place.
      Sentient AI is great in practice but worse in reality, our tech and infastructure is not ready to handle true sentience.
