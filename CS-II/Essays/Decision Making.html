    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      We will discuss how, when working on our selected business plan, we will overcome the decision making biases.
      The first step to overcoming biases is understanding them, and we will discuss five individual biases.
      We will review imageability, inconsistency, overconfidence, sample, and scale as our biases.
      Then the last step is to determine how we will overcome these biases.
    </p>
    <h1>Decision Makining Biases</h1>
    <p>
      The first bias we are going to talk about is imaginability.
      When we imagine how a project will be created, it seems easy in our heads, but it can be a daunting task when we implement it into our project.
      We can call this imageability. Arnott (1998) quoted, "An event will be judged more probable if it can be easily imagined." (p. 14), and this is an excellent summary of imageability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second bias is inconsistency.
      Arnott (1998) describes this as "a common judgement pattern even for experienced decision makers" (p. 14).
      This describes how people judge things differently, especially if there is no consistent judgment strategy.
      When writing backend code in our project, it is easy to overlook good code quality if the final product works.
      Our team can lead to some significant headaches while trying to debug or change our project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third basis is overconfidence.
      We can think of this as being underprepared but thinking we have this.
      We see this as a problem with procrastination or project time management.
      Overconfidence in ourselves can be used to suggest that our plan will last forever when it is replaced with a better solution later.
      An example is when Polaroid needed to see innovation and thought they were super confident in their current polaroid products that they went bankrupt because they innovated too late into digital cameras. (Vedantam & Smith, 2022)
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth bias is sample.
      Arnott (1998) said, "The size of a sample is often ignored in judging its predictive power." (p. 19).
      This quote means that we can think less of the test when we perceive the sample size to be lower.
      An example is when we are going to test our software on students.
      While there may only be 100 students in the sample, we can think less of what they say than when we deploy to over 5000 students and get feedback, but their response is critical to understand what problems we may encounter with a larger group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final bais is scale.
      Arnott (1998) said, "The perceived variability of data can be effected by the scale of the data." (p. 19).
      This quote means that when we scale, we will have many data points for a user to pick.
      When we have a large amount of data, the results of what a user can pick are varied.
      While some may only pick a few options and select a few timeslots, others might have complex schedules, and a matrix is required to complete them at the end.
    </p>
    <h1>Overcoming Biases</h1>
    <p>
      We plan to overcome biases we might face while building, testing, and publishing our code.
      The first step we have to face is to layout the structure of our code using a flow chart to solve imagination and overconfidence to create a clear understanding of the work required.
      The second step would be to organize our code and create a policy for contributing with code formatting rules, solving our inconsistency bias.
      The final two biases are harder for our group to come up with solutions.
      While they require students to understand the bias and what effect it might have on what decisions we decide as a collective.
      I think that we can adequately manage our biases as a group and create a good project.
