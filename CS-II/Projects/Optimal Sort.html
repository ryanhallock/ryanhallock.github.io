    <h1>Part 1 - Sort Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      Whilst sorting and plotting all the data, the data shows that bubble sort is the slowest.
      The reason that bubble sort is the slowest is that it has to go over the array and compare everytime.
      While with the other sorting algorithms the size they have to search shrinks over time.
      The number of passes insertion and selection sort is equal to the number of elements.
      That being said, insertion sort is slower on a larger list as it compares all the previous elements but still faster than bubble sort.
      Using these results, selection sort beat out the completion by showing up to 22s compared bubble sorts 150s in 100,000 strings.
      <br><br>
      More accurately, insertion sort on reversed ordered is the slowest, whilst bubble sort is slowest overall (not far behind on reverse).
      Selection sort was the fastest overall.
      The reason is that it srunk its compare size with each pass.
      It did this by pushing it all to the left, while others still compared already switched values.
