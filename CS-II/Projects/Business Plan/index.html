      Creating a system to to indentify scheduling of the bus routing and providing reasonable information to the end user.

    <hr><h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
    <p>
      The problem that the buses seem always late or not on time, stuck in traffic or broken down.
      Without direct contant to the teacher or student body.
      While there is direct contant with the bus depot to the administration the ladder to receive the information could take a couple minutes.

    <hr><h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
    <p>
      To solve the issues presented above, it is possible to track and show the current bus route to the end user.
      You might be asking on how this is possible. The current buses in ASID's fleet are equpiped with GPS.
      That is visible to the district administration.
      The current system will have to introduce and API endpoint for the application to function.
      As all routes are already known and planned it could show the estimated time of arrival and if the bus is currently running late or behind schedule.
