      is about a brain teaser game where you have to find macthing pairs of characters on a board. While its is apposed to be an app I think the publicity will be the hardest part about it. Also publishing to Apple/Android could also lead to some privacy concerns on both parties.

      is about converting programming languages into another language. The major issue I see with with librarys, introducing a library would also have to convert the entire library. The thing going for it is the LLVM transcomplation.

      is about a student extracurricular app. The app will allow people to track there points, check what events and post on their profile. I don't like this project as it displays rank, which can be negative to a students health.

      is about an app that can show recipes with the specified ingredients. It will allow people to cook by just specifying what they have. The biggest problem on this app, is the database of food related items and what ingredients and substitutions.

      is about controlling a window shade to only allow a certain amount of light in at any time. While it does seem interesting and could be done with a Pi and an electric motor. I don't see how this could compete in a market where this product is already explored.

      is about creating an neural network to play popular games. While the concept does seem interesting the hard part is how do you come up with a model for ALL games. I don't see this a plausible but would be interesting if completed.

      is about pre-ordering cafeteria food with an app. While this is possible it would be hard to implement with payments. This is also difficult for students and the district to accept and fully use. An idea to combat this and make it easy for the student is to create presets which they can select and pay for.

      is about using facial recogition for attendance. This does seem like a really cool concept. I don't see this plausible with adoption with students and staff. People can also cite privacy concerns with traning data being used to create deep-fakes.

      is about RFID student IDs. The district already has these, mostly with staff and not with students. I havent seen there adoption into classes or students yet. If it does get adopted it can create a way to gather attendance. I dont think it will get adpopted cause the cost of the scanners and then the cost of writing validity software.
