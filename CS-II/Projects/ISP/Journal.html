        We are going to discuss the technical, scheduling and interpersonal challenges that were had while working on the model scheduler.
      </p>
      <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Techinal Challenges for this week, include database, login process.
        We have not received what Personal Identifiable Information we can receive from a user.
        This results in a struggle on authentication flow.
        We are also having issues when it comes to creating a valid workflow.
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        No suprise Scheduling is still the biggest issue.
        While everyone has been busy, most classmates have tests/pep-rally/sports coming up.
        We have not had any type of meeting this week.
        Progress has slowed, due to communcation slowing.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Part of the team is radio silence still.
        While I might be contrubiting to this, because I was very silent this week while working on other personal projects.
        I think next week might be a more productive week for me, and the team.
        We are going to mitigate this issue with a `CONTRUBUTING.md` file.

      </p>
      <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        The technical issues that were observed this week, we had issues seting up vapor.
        Using Vapor documentation would fail to build and cause sub-processes to remain and hog resources.
        Instead we used a VaporLibrary provided by CoderMerlin.
        This slowed our progress alot.
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Scheduling is still the biggest issue.
        We would schedule a meeting and only a small portion 40%< would show.
        Key members that needed to be there were also missing and the meeting was not very productive.
        We also had issues with scheduling as we lost a day next week due to internet issues.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Part of the team is radio silence.
        Most of the radio silence people have no idea what there doing but not asking questions on Discord/Github
        I blame myself as a Product Manager on not having a good struture of how this project should be setup but I am working to improve on that.
        This puts the Project Manager in a tough spot not knowing how to assign work.

      <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        The technical issues that were observed this week.
        We had issues with people being able to use Github.
        While people were able to commit to github and others were stuck and confused on the system we were setting up.
        We also had issues with able to properly work on a single file.
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Scheduling was the biggest issue of this week
        Trying to schedule talks and communication was a problem, but we had strong moves with creating a discord server for more chat/calling.
        We still suffered from separated periods during classtime and separated schedules.
        Some of this could have been alleviated if we created meetings, which should start next week.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        While team issues weren't a big problem this week we did have some stressed moments.
        While working on our project everyone would commit a message to the same file.
        This led to people fighting, and merging there file.
        At the end, I decided to just to create a pull request to resolve this issue that included all the changes that needed to be made.
