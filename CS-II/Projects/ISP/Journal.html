        We are going to discuss the technical, scheduling and interpersonal challenges that were had while working on the model scheduler.
      </p>
      <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Techinal Challenges for this week, include database, login process.
        The biggest issue is database. Database had duplicate classes and was not compressed resulting in bad demand caculation.
        Our database was provided wrong and while it still functions, bug fixes need to be applied.
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        No suprise Scheduling was the biggest issue.
        The project has released and bug fixes are slow coming as
        people who worked on it are demotivated from the project.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Part of the team is radio silence still.
        Most issues were created and resolved inside discord.
      </p>
      <h3>Significant Achievements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Progress slowed due to burnout from previous week.</li>
        <li>Discussion kept happing inside Discord.</li>

      <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Techinal Challenges for this week, include database, login process.
        We have recived what info we can use and partial final database.
        Demand caculation was made this week.
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        No suprise Scheduling is still the biggest issue.
        Not many people wanted to work after spring break.
        This was also considered crunch week before our release.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Part of the team is radio silence still.
        This seems to be a reoccuring issue. While we dont ever see these people sometime it is hard to communicate with them.

      <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Techinal Challenges for this week, include database, login process.
        I decided to migrate away from using a secrets file into a .env file.
        This brought some confusion as many team members are new to ISP's
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        No suprise Scheduling is still the biggest issue.
        Not everyone has time to work on a project this big.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Part of the team is radio silence still.
        I also had some backlash by switching to a .env file.

      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        No suprise Scheduling is still an issue.

      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        No suprise Scheduling is still the biggest issue.
        Last week we had an day break.
      </p>

        Part of the team is radio silence still.

      <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Techinal Challenges for this week, include database, login process.
        We have still not received what Personal Identifiable Information we can receive from a user.
        This results in a struggle on authentication flow.
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        No suprise Scheduling is still the biggest issue.
        Progress is slowed but picking up pace again.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Part of the team is radio silence still. I was busy with rising assignments

        We have not received what Personal Identifiable Information we can receive from a user.
        This results in a struggle on authentication flow.
        We are also having issues when it comes to creating a valid workflow.
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        No suprise Scheduling is still the biggest issue.
        While everyone has been busy, most classmates have tests/pep-rally/sports coming up.
        We have not had any type of meeting this week.
        Progress has slowed, due to communcation slowing.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Part of the team is radio silence still.
        While I might be contrubiting to this, because I was very silent this week while working on other personal projects.
        I think next week might be a more productive week for me, and the team.
        We are going to mitigate this issue with a `CONTRUBUTING.md` file.

        Not everyone had acesss to use discord on there platform.
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        No suprise Scheduling is still the biggest issue.
        Not everyone can dedicate time to work on the model scheduler this week with issues/commits.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Part of the team is radio silence still.
        We are working inside of discord to setup roles and methods for working.
        I was mostly talking inside the discord and not activitly working on issues/commits as I was busy.

      <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        The technical issues that were observed this week, we had issues seting up vapor.
        Using Vapor documentation would fail to build and cause sub-processes to remain and hog resources.
        Instead we used a VaporLibrary provided by CoderMerlin.
        This slowed our progress alot.
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Scheduling is still the biggest issue.
        We would schedule a meeting and only a small portion 40%< would show.
        Key members that needed to be there were also missing and the meeting was not very productive.
        We also had issues with scheduling as we lost a day next week due to internet issues.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Part of the team is radio silence.
        Most of the radio silence people have no idea what there doing but not asking questions on Discord/Github
        I blame myself as a Product Manager on not having a good struture of how this project should be setup but I am working to improve on that.
        This puts the Project Manager in a tough spot not knowing how to assign work.

      </p>
      <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        The technical issues that were observed this week.
        We had issues with people being able to use Github.
        While people were able to commit to github and others were stuck and confused on the system we were setting up.
        We also had issues with able to properly work on a single file.
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Scheduling was the biggest issue of this week
        Trying to schedule talks and communication was a problem, but we had strong moves with creating a discord server for more chat/calling.
        We still suffered from separated periods during classtime and separated schedules.
        Some of this could have been alleviated if we created meetings, which should start next week.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        While team issues weren't a big problem this week we did have some stressed moments.
        While working on our project everyone would commit a message to the same file.
        This led to people fighting, and merging there file.
        At the end, I decided to just to create a pull request to resolve this issue that included all the changes that needed to be made.

        I will discuss what positions are required for our ISP and duties the role has.
        The roles I am going to discuss are Software Development Engineer, Quality Assurance Engineer, Project Manager, Product Manager and Release Engineer.
      </p>
      <h3>Software Development Engineer</h3>
      <p>
        Software Development Engineer have a key role inside the team.
        This includes a collaborating with other team members to create underlying code.
        Also includes designing and documenting code.
        While also receiving feedback from managers and customers on what can be improved.
      </p>
      <h3>Quality Assurance Engineer</h3>
      <p>
        A quality assurance engineer will break the program.
        Well, try to break it I mean.
        By doing this they will find bugs and report them to get fixed.
        They will also create tests to prevent issues from happening and ensuring code stability.
      </p>
      <h3>Project Manager</h3>
      <p>
        A project manager is a leader for the developers.
        They need to communicate with the team to solve issues.
        They are also able to assist with deadline scheduling.
        They also need to coordinate events and meetings for the team insuring performance.
      </p>
      <h3>Product Manager</h3>
      <p>
        A product manager decides what gets "shipped" in the final product.
        They are responsible for telling the project manager what features they want.
        They are responsible for talking to the end customer about end features.
        While also creating estimates on when something will be done and update the customer.
      </p>
      <h3>Release Engineer</h3>
      <p>
        A release engineer is a final gate to the main push.
        There position requires them to proactively identify issues in the build process.
        They are required to understand a project to near entirety.
        Sometimes are required to troubleshoot issues with a program and can assist an QA engineer.
