        We are going to discuss the technical, scheduling and interpersonal challenges that were had while working on the model scheduler.
      </p>
      <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        The technical issues that were observed this week.
        We had issues with people being able to use Github.
        While people were able to commit to github and others were stuck and confused on the system we were setting up.
        We also had issues with able to properly work on a single file.
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Scheduling was the biggest issue of this week.
        Trying to schedule talks and communication was a problem, but we had strong moves with creating a discord server for more chat/calling.
        We still suffered from separated periods during classtime and separated schedules.
        Some of this could have been alleviated if we created meetings, which should start next week.
      </p>
      <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        While team issues weren't a big problem this week we did have some stressed moments.
        While working on our project everyone would commit a message to the same file.
        This led to people fighting, and merging there file.
        At the end, I decided to just to create a pull request to resolve this issue that included all the changes that needed to be made.
